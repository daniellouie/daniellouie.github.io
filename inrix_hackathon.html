            <p>Participating in my first hackathon was an incredibly challenging yet rewarding experience. Hackathons had always seemed daunting to me but I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone as I'm proud of the skills I learned and my team's working final project!</p>
            <p>Our team's inspiration stemmed from a real-world problem: the surge in car break-ins in San Francisco, particularly affecting tourists unfamiliar with their parking surroundings. Determined to address this issue, we conceptualized "Safe Park SF," a web application that combines crime data with Inrix's on-street parking API to recommend the safest parking spots near any given address.</p>
            <p>The project's complexity was evident from the start, but our diverse team of first-time hackers was up for the challenge. Frontend development involved using Google Maps API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing us to seamlessly integrate the map, Google Places search bar, and backend Flask proxy API. On the backend, Python and Flask powered the logic, with a weighted algorithm refining parking recommendations based on crime data and parking space probabilities from INRIX.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, challenges emerged throughout our journey. The initial decision to use React for the frontend proved inefficient within our tight time frame. Consulting with mentors, including those from ACM and Inrix, led us to pivot to a simpler frontend using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, streamlining our development process.            </p>
            <p>Our proudest moments were when we successfully connected the frontend and backend, making seamless requests to our proxy API. Delivering a functional product within 24 hours was a testament to our teamwork and determination, especially considering it was our inaugural hackathon.</p>

            <p>The learning curve was steep, but invaluable. Navigating frameworks and APIs for web applications, establishing communication between frontend and backend, and adapting to unforeseen challenges were just a few of the skills we developed. The experience also honed our interpersonal skills, as collaboration became essential under the pressure of a looming deadline.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, Safe Park SF has exciting potential for growth. Future iterations could include user-input radius customization, weight adjustments for different types of car crimes, and more detailed parking information. We envision adding functionality for calculating the optimal route based on parking quality along the way.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, SCU's INRIX Recruiting Hackathon was not just a coding marathon but a transformative experience. From struggling with project ideation to demonstrating a functional web-app to Inrix executives, this hackathon has been a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills and I'm excited at the possibilities it opens up for future hackathons and personal projects!</p>
