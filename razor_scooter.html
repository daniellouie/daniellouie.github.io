            <p>In the summer of 8th grade, I was looking for a new project when I came across a Razor Scooter that my dad had abandoned using for a project of his own. It was in terrible shape, the paint was peeling and nothing worked.</p>
            <p>My friend and I spent the next week identifying all the problems and learning how to fix them. Included in that list were the SLA batteries, the motor and motor controller which all required replacements. After rewiring the replacements and making some other modifications, we carefully disassembled the shell and gave it a clean paint job.</p>

            </div>
            <p>It was the greatest feeling to me when I first twisted the throttle of the finished bike and felt it lurch beneath me.</p>
            <p>This project kickstarted my passion for learning about and making electric bikes of all kinds. Since then, I have made two other e-bikes, each unique in appearance and use-case as well as in the skills I learned to make them. Go check them and my other projects out!</p>
