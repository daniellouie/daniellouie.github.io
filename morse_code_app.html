            <p>During the summer of 2021, I took advantage of the changes caused by Covid-19 to teach myself Swift. I learned so much and realized the endless potential of this app making tool. Since then, I'm constantly thinking of ideas for apps of all times. One of my favorites is a Morse Code translator app.</p>
            <p>A user would type a message in English and the app would convert it into both written Morse code, composed of dits ('.') and dahs ('-'), as well as visually by using the phone's flashlight to flash the message. While this English-to-Morse translation has been done before, my app would use the phone's camera to capture the flashing light emitted by another device and use computer vision to decode the flashes into English for the receiving user. This two-way translation could allow for back and forth communication without the need to know Morse code.</p>
            <p>Recently, I wrote an initial version of the app. It can translate a user message from English to flashing Morse code and well as in written form that they can copy and paste for use later. Since Morse code is based on a unit of time measurement, my app lets the user to choose the unit (in seconds) of the message. Allowing the user to determine the speed that the message is executed is an undervalued feature that I have not seen in any existing Morse code apps.</p>

            <p>While this is a rough version of the app's interface, I am really happy with how it turned out and am still amazed that I was able to learn a program on my own, think of an idea, and turn in into my very own app. I can't wait to continue working on this and the rest of the apps I will build!</p>
